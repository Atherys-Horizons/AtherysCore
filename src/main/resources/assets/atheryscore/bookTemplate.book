${player.name} had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
${player.name} had a little lamb
Whose fleece was white as snow.

And everywhere that Mary went
${player.name} went, ${player.name} went,
Everywhere that ${player.name} went
The lamb was sure to go.

He followed her to school one day, school one day, school one day
He followed her to school one day
Which was against the rules.
